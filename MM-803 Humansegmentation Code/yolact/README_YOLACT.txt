# **Y**ou **O**nly **L**ook **A**t **C**oefficien**T**s

A simple, fully convolutional model for real-time instance segmentation.

# Installation
 - Set up a Python3 environment.
 - Install [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) 1.0.1 (or higher) and TorchVision.
 - Install some other packages:
   ```Shell
   # Cython needs to be installed before pycocotools
   pip install cython
   pip install opencv-python pillow pycocotools matplotlib 
   ```
 - Clone this repository and enter it:
   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/dbolya/yolact.git
   cd yolact
   ```
 - If you'd like to train YOLACT, download the COCO dataset and the 2014/2017 annotations. Note that this script will take a while and dump 21gb of files into `./data/coco`.
   ```Shell
   sh data/scripts/COCO.sh
   ```
 - If you'd like to evaluate YOLACT on `test-dev`, download `test-dev` with this script.
   ```Shell
   sh data/scripts/COCO_test.sh
   ```



# Training
By default, we train on COCO. Make sure to download the entire dataset using the commands above.
 - To train, grab an imagenet-pretrained model and put it in `./weights`.
   - For Resnet101, download `resnet101_reducedfc.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvqFPd4bJtakOlmn-uIA492g2qurRChj/view?usp=sharing).
   - For Resnet50, download `resnet50-19c8e357.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jy3yCdbatgXa5YYIdTCRrSV0S9V5g1rn/view?usp=sharing).
   - For Darknet53, download `darknet53.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Y431j4sagFpSReuPNoFcj9h7azDTZFf/view?usp=sharing).
 - Run one of the training commands below.
   - Note that you can press ctrl+c while training and it will save an `*_interrupt.pth` file at the current iteration.
   - All weights are saved in the `./weights` directory by default with the file name `<config>_<epoch>_<iter>.pth`.
```Shell
# Trains using the base config with a batch size of 8 (the default).
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config

# Trains yolact_base_config with a batch_size of 5. For the 550px models, 1 batch takes up around 1.5 gigs of VRAM, so specify accordingly.
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config --batch_size=5

# Resume training yolact_base with a specific weight file and start from the iteration specified in the weight file's name.
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config --resume=weights/yolact_base_10_32100.pth --start_iter=-1

# Use the help option to see a description of all available command line arguments
python train.py --help
```
